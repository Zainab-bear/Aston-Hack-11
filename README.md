# 🌱 SkillSprout  
**The Ecosystem of Kindness**

> Small acts. Big impact. This is the future we were promised.

---

## 🧩 The Problem
Modern neighborhoods are increasingly isolated, even while living closer than ever.  
At the same time, usable items are thrown away because sharing is difficult, trust is low, and warranties or repair histories are lost.

The traditional **sharing economy** has faded replaced by over consumption and disconnection.

---

## 💡 The Solution
**SkillSprout** is a hyper local community platform that transforms everyday favors into measurable **environmental and social impact**.

We built a **Frutiger Aero inspired dashboard** where neighbors share **Skills, Items, and Workshops** as **Seeds** planted into a shared ecosystem.

Each Seed:
- Strengthens community bonds  
- Reduces waste  
- Uses AI to quantify sustainability impact  
- Preserves the *story* behind shared items  

Guiding the ecosystem is **Ollie the Octopus 🐙**, our friendly community mascot and item-health guardian.

---

## 🌍 The Vision
Reclaiming the *“future we were promised”* — where technology feels optimistic, clean, and human centric.

SkillSprout isn’t just an app.  
It’s **digital soil where communities grow resilience together**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌱 Seed Based Sharing System
Users plant **Seeds** representing:
- **Skills** (e.g. teaching yoga)
- **Items** (e.g. lending a drill)
- **Workshops** (e.g. community coding sessions)

Each Seed contributes to a shared **Community Impact Meter**.

---

### 🤖 AI Impact Estimator (Google Gemini)
- Powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**
- Reads each Seed’s **Community Story**
- Instantly estimates **CO₂ savings**
- Turns simple favors into **measurable sustainability actions**

📁 Code Reference: `geminiService.ts`

---

### 🐙 Ollie the Octopus (Majestic Challenge)
Ollie acts as a **Community Guide**, helping bridge community sharing with manufacturer warranties.

For **Item Seeds**, Ollie supports:
- Warranty awareness  
- Item condition tracking  
- Repair and reuse cycles  

Keeping items useful  and **out of landfills**  for longer.

---

### 📊 Community Vitals Dashboard
A real time impact dashboard showing:
- Items Saved  
- Hours Shared  
- CO₂ Reduced  
- Neighborhood Vitality Meter  

Built using **recharts**, this dashboard provides clear evidence of environmental and social impact.

📁 Code Reference: `ImpactDashboard.tsx`

---

### 📖 The Untold Challenge  Community Story Archive
To address the **Untold Challenge**, SkillSprout transforms standard item descriptions into a **Community Story Archive**.

Instead of listing specs, users share:
> Who used the item  
> What it helped build  
> How it supported the community  

This preserves **hidden social capital** and turns tools into vessels of shared memory.

---

### 🧭 Single Page Application (SPA)
SkillSprout is built as a **Single Page Application**:
- Instant navigation  
- No page reloads  
- Smooth, app like experience  

📁 Code Reference: `App.tsx`

---

## 🎨 Design Language — Frutiger Aero
While most platforms use dark, industrial interfaces, SkillSprout embraces:
- Glossy gradients  
- Organic shapes  
- Nature inspired optimism  

Technology should feel **welcoming, not cold**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Lucide Icons  
- Recharts  
- Google Gemini API  
- LocalStorage (prototype persistence)

---

## 🧱 Architecture & Scalability
This prototype uses **LocalStorage** for lightning fast persistence.

The data layer is **reactive and modular**, designed to migrate seamlessly to:
- PostgreSQL  
- Supabase  
- City wide or global deployments
